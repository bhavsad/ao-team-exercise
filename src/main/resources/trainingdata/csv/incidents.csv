"We were performing our 6 month inspection (2nd Bi-Annual Service) when we were checking the Vacuum Regulators filters when we found (2) broken indicating tube on the post chlorine gas feed system.  One unit had a 1/16"" hole in the glass and the other just had a crack. The hole and crack would allow air to be sucked into the regulator and lower the amount of Chlorine Gas being fed into the system, or if the system itself shuts off Chlorine Gas would exit into the air around the crack. This is caused by the Main Switchover device being set to high allowing the vacuum to build to a point that when it does switch over it projects the float to the top of the rotameter where a top stop is there to cushion the float.  Over time the top stop becomes hard (Chlorine Gas dries out the top stop) and causes the float to go in another direction which is to the side creating the crack.  We have adjusted the Main Switchover to switch at a lower rate and it will create less vacuum.  We also are changing the top stop every 6 months to keep a softer top stop in place.  ",-CHEMICAL

"The Annual Service was being performed, and I found a Ton Container Mounting Kit with the threads ate up at the point of entry to the mounting kit.  This occurs because we added the required Halogen adapter to offset the Vacuum Regulator to attach the Halogen Emergency Shut off valve.  The gas moving thru this adapter ""Flashes Off"" and leaves a deposit at this point.  Over a period of time this point of entry will decay and create a potential hazard, because at this point we are under Chlorine Tank pressure of anywhere from 80 to as much as 120 psi depending upon the heat of the room, and with only 3 thread holding the unit on, the unit itself could blow off and release Chlorine Gas.

The meter reader used the metal rod that is carried to lift meter lids to beat the dogs to keep from being bitten. The meter reader backed up against a church to have no way for the dogs to approach him from behind and was able to fend them off with the rod. After the dogs gave up the meter reader retreated to the truck and called the police and was directed to animal control and was not able to get through. The meter reader called me and I advised to stop reading the area.

"A Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) was replaced near housing on Hill Air Force Base.  Electrical work was scheduled to be performed by a contractor to complete the replacement project.  The contractor hired by American Water had subcontracted this electrical work out to another company.  The contractor met in the morning to discuss the job plan for the day and what hazards and mediations where necessary for the days work.  In discussing the electrical work it was decided that the work area would be a permit required confined space.  As the contractor was collecting the necessary safety equipment needed for the confined space the electrical subcontractor arrived on site.  Upon arriving at the work site the subcontractor proceeded to enter the PRV vault to complete his work, not waiting for the safety devices to arrive.  An American Water employee, Dan Bond, drove by the project and stopped in to check on the progress.  Upon arriving Mr. Bond noticed that the subcontractor was working in the vault with no confined space safety equipment.

"Employee was in the C&P warehouse when he noticed a strong sewer like odor. He notified another employee who contacted Andrea Thomas about the odor. Andrea went over to the location and was able to determine that the strong odor was coming from the portable stop light trailer. Andrea recognized the odor as that of hydrogen sulfide, so she obtained a confined space meter and tested the atmosphere inside the enclosed trailer. The hydrogen sulfide alarm was activated and readings were stable around 15 ppm. Andrea called the manufacture and she had the trailer moved to the rear parking lot. Once outside, the trailer doors were opened to allow for ventilation. The atmosphere was tested inside the trailer before entry. Once the general atmosphere tested safe, Andrea tested each one of the four units battery compartments to determine the source. She found 2 of the four battery compartments to contain 73 ppm of CO, 5 ppm H2S and 7 ppm LEL (on average). We suspect that the ""smart charger"" is malfunctioning and is continuously charging the batteries causing them to over heat and off-gas harmful gases. State H&S lead has called and the vendor and they are coming 4/15/16 to check the internal trailer charging mechanism. If this situation had not been recognized it may have resulted in an explosion, fire, property damage and/or injury. ",-NEGLIGENCE

"On the morning of Dec. 28, while I was performing my routine day-to-day survey of the Water Treatment Plant, I had walked around the building to find my immediate supervisor. I had greeted her, and we talked for a few minutes. At the time we had a contractor on site, so I figured that she was here to talk with him. So I proceeded with my daily duties, and on this particular  day I needed to add 2 chemicals to the day tanks; one being chlorine and the other being potassium permanganate. When an operator deals with any chemical it is required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment, in this case nitrile gloves and the use of a full face respirator. While I was adding the potassium permanganate, which for those of you who do not know what this is, it is a fine dusty powder which can become airborne, and is known as an oxidizing chemical. One that you would not want to get in your skin, eyes, nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Now while I was in the chemical room mixing this powder and water solution, my supervisor approached me and attempted to have a conversation with me. This was an unappropriate time for several reasons, 1) Supervisor put herself in a potential hazardous situation, with out donning the right PPE 2) Distracting an operator while performing a task such as dealing with chemicals 3) While wearing a full face respirator it is difficult to talk, and puts added stress on that operator. Now the things to take away from this incident are 1) If you see someone wearing PPE you might want to asses the environment, and question yourself if this is a safe environment for you to be in? 2) If you see someone wearing PPE and is clearly performing a duty, should you interrupt that person? -Yes, if that person is in or can be in danger. -No, the conversation can wait for a later time.

All indicated a blockage in the supply piping, vacuum regulator or automatic switch over device.  Chlorine feed was resumed through a bypass supply valve and the blockage was investigated.  There are two ton cylinders connected together to supply chlorine on this system.  When the whip was removed from one of the cylinders, it was noticed that there were two lead gaskets on the yoke to cylinder valve connection.  When the lead gaskets were removed, one gasket had a hole in it and the other lead gasket was solid.  This was the blockage.  The scale indicated 1980 pounds because one of the cylinders was depleted and the other was full due to the solid lead gasket.  When cylinders are delivered, a cap with a gasket is on the cylinder valve.  This cap is removed to attach the yoke valve.  The operator did not realize the solid lead gasket remained on the cylinder valve and attached the yoke valve with an additional lead gasket.

"This was found during a Bi-Annual Maintenance inspection on January 14, 2016.  It could have leaked Chlorine Gas (if the plant shut down) or pulled a Vacuum on the system and kept the Chlorine from feeding.  This is a defect in the back housing of this type of regulator.  I've seen it in many locations thru out our State as well as in other facilities.  We look for this every time we perform this service.  We typically catch it before it gets this bad.  This occurs because the insert inside the middle housing is recessed below the outer surface of the middle housing and when the back housing is attached, over time, it pulls down on the back housing and eventually cracks.  The manufacture has been notified and so far nothing has been done about it.  This style of regulator came out in 1996.  The cost of the back housing is around $30.

We encountered a rise is CO (carbon monoxide) on our borrowed LEL meter to the point where it went into alarm mode indicating a high level of CO present in the pit being measured approximately 12 feet down.  The first time, last week, we attributed the levels to the excessive amount of water and the fact that the pit hadn't been opened for an unknown amount of time.  This week the pit has minimal water, surface moisture at most, and we were venting with the blower when we encountered high levels again. We attempted to move the blower downwind and upwind to alter results but with varying winds we couldn't keep up. Due to the nature of the exhaust pipe (see pictures, it's the short rusted pipe with the adapter on the end) it's exhausting directly at the intake point and with varying winds we kept seeing varying levels of CO. Upon removing the blower and waiting a few moments we were able to see acceptable levels in a short time.

As they were in the process of removing the pump they noted that an unusual amount of water was leaking past a steel plate that was installed last year and they had concerns if it was too much water to deal with. The crew notified the supervisor who contacted the safety manger to come out and perform a site visit so they could together plan out the best way to manage the issue. It was determined that the leak was too severe to continue and that the best course of action would be to wait until the river level drops lower than the steel plate and then to have a contractor repair the hole permanently,-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE
"This was found during a Bi-Annual Maintenance inspection on January 14, 2016.  It could have leaked Chlorine Gas (if the plant shut down) or pulled a Vacuum on the system and kept the Chlorine from feeding.  This is a defect in the back housing of this type of regulator.  I've seen it in many locations thru out our State as well as in other facilities.  We look for this every time we perform this service.  We typically catch it before it gets this bad.  This occurs because the insert inside the middle housing is recessed below the outer surface of the middle housing and when the back housing is attached, over time, it pulls down on the back housing and eventually cracks.  The manufacture has been notified and so far nothing has been done about it.  This style of regulator came out in 1996.  The cost of the back housing is around $30.  We have repaired the unit by installing a new back housing. Problem is solved at this location. ",-HAZARDOUS_CHEMICAL-CHEMICAL-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"We were performing our 6 month inspection (2nd Bi-Annual Service) when we were checking the Vacuum Regulators filters when we found (2) broken indicating tube on the post chlorine gas feed system.  One unit had a 1/16"" hole in the glass and the other just had a crack. The hole and crack would allow air to be sucked into the regulator and lower the amount of Chlorine Gas being fed into the system, or if the system itself shuts off Chlorine Gas would exit into the air around the crack. This is caused by the Main Switchover device being set to high allowing the vacuum to build to a point that when it does switch over it projects the float to the top of the rotameter where a top stop is there to cushion the float.  Over time the top stop becomes hard (Chlorine Gas dries out the top stop) and causes the float to go in another direction which is to the side creating the crack.  We have adjusted the Main Switchover to switch at a lower rate and it will create less vacuum.  We also are changing the top stop every 6 months to keep a softer top stop in place.  ",-CHEMICAL

On April 20, 2016 at 0830 American Water personnel arrived at the job site to turn valves and shut water off to the water main being worked on. At that time a trench box was in place and personnel were working in the excavation. The job site and excavation appeared to be in compliance with OSHA and AW regulations and requirements. AW advised the subcontractor personnel that a second trench box would be needed to complete the tasks or the excavation would need to be widened by sloping the excavation walls. Water was still flowing so AW personnel left the job site to exercise valves to see if the water could be isolated completely.  At 1000 AW personnel returned to the excavation. AW personnel noticed that the trench box was removed and tools were in the bottom of the excavation indicating that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation with out proper protection. At 1022 Chris Mair, AW Health and Safety Specialist, received notification from American Water workers of a possible issue with the subcontractor performing excavation work. At 1035 Chris Mair requested to meet the subcontractor's management on scene to go over the excavation job and proper procedures that needed to be followed.  Upon arriving at the scene at 1100, it was confirmed that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation without proper shoring. American Water and the subcontractor went over with all personnel the excavation requirements and developed a plan forward. Workers widened the excavation but did not step the walls or reinstall shoring before reentering the excavation at 1130. American Water stopped all work at that time and notified the subcontractor's management of the issues. It was decided that a stop work order would be issued and that additional training needed to take place in order to ensure the safety of all workers involved. Training expectations were discussed and agreed upon between American Water and the subcontractor. AW directed that no work would continue until all training was completed and reviewed. In addition, American Water requested that an investigation report be submitted for the incident and a change in site supervisor/competent person be made.

"On the morning of Dec. 28, while I was performing my routine day-to-day survey of the Water Treatment Plant, I had walked around the building to find my immediate supervisor. I had greeted her, and we talked for a few minutes. At the time we had a contractor on site, so I figured that she was here to talk with him. So I proceeded with my daily duties, and on this particular  day I needed to add 2 chemicals to the day tanks; one being chlorine and the other being potassium permanganate. When an operator deals with any chemical it is required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment, in this case nitrile gloves and the use of a full face respirator. While I was adding the potassium permanganate, which for those of you who do not know what this is, it is a fine dusty powder which can become airborne, and is known as an oxidizing chemical. One that you would not want to get in your skin, eyes, nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Now while I was in the chemical room mixing this powder and water solution, my supervisor approached me and attempted to have a conversation with me. This was an unappropriate time for several reasons, 1) Supervisor put herself in a potential hazardous situation, with out donning the right PPE 2) Distracting an operator while performing a task such as dealing with chemicals 3) While wearing a full face respirator it is difficult to talk, and puts added stress on that operator. Now the things to take away from this incident are 1) If you see someone wearing PPE you might want to asses the environment, and question yourself if this is a safe environment for you to be in? 2) If you see someone wearing PPE and is clearly performing a duty, should you interrupt that person? -Yes, if that person is in or can be in danger. -No, the conversation can wait for a later time.

I immediately stopped the driver who seemed to be clueless as to the product he was dealing with and informed him that caustic has a negative reaction with aluminum which could result in an explosion of the pump.  I redirected him to hook the plant air directly to the tanker and pressurize the tanker in order to move the product.  ",-CHEMICAL-NEGLIGENCE

"The operator reported that the post chlorine feed system was not feeding properly.  Maintenance personnel were sent to the chlorine feed room to investigate.  The scale on the south post cylinders indicated 1980 pounds remaining in the cylinders.  Pressure on the header indicated ""0"" psi.  The post chlorinator was not indicating chlorine flow.  All indicated a blockage in the supply piping, vacuum regulator or automatic switch over device.  Chlorine feed was resumed through a bypass supply valve and the blockage was investigated.  There are two ton cylinders connected together to supply chlorine on this system.  When the whip was removed from one of the cylinders, it was noticed that there were two lead gaskets on the yoke to cylinder valve connection.  When the lead gaskets were removed, one gasket had a hole in it and the other lead gasket was solid.  This was the blockage.  The scale indicated 1980 pounds because one of the cylinders was depleted and the other was full due to the solid lead gasket.  When cylinders are delivered, a cap with a gasket is on the cylinder valve.  This cap is removed to attach the yoke valve.  The operator did not realize the solid lead gasket remained on the cylinder valve and attached the yoke valve with an additional lead gasket.  I spoke with our supplier about the incident and they informed me that some caps have a composite gasket and newer ones have a solid lead gasket.  what we learned from this incident is the importance of paying attention to details.  There should not have been two gaskets on the connection, one of them being solid.  Always remove any gasket and replace it with a new one.  Also, check for any foreign objects in the connection.  Suppliers may change little things and feel it is not necessary to inform the customer.  Comments were made by personnel that they had never seen a solid gasket in the cap.

"This was found during a Bi-Annual Maintenance inspection on January 14, 2016.  It could have leaked Chlorine Gas (if the plant shut down) or pulled a Vacuum on the system and kept the Chlorine from feeding.  This is a defect in the back housing of this type of regulator.  I've seen it in many locations thru out our State as well as in other facilities.  We look for this every time we perform this service.  We typically catch it before it gets this bad.  This occurs because the insert inside the middle housing is recessed below the outer surface of the middle housing and when the back housing is attached, over time, it pulls down on the back housing and eventually cracks.  The manufacture has been notified and so far nothing has been done about it.  This style of regulator came out in 1996.  The cost of the back housing is around $30.  We have repaired the unit by installing a new back housing. Problem is solved at this location. ",-HAZARDOUS_CHEMICAL-CHEMICAL-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"In an attempt to raise our tank levels we've been regulating our PRV's. Our PRV's are located in pits below ground level requiring, with our new training, the monitoring of the environment. Today was our second time raising our levels and we experienced a identical problem as we did last week. We encountered a rise is CO (carbon monoxide) on our borrowed LEL meter to the point where it went into alarm mode indicating a high level of CO present in the pit being measured approximately 12 feet down.  The first time, last week, we attributed the levels to the excessive amount of water and the fact that the pit hadn't been opened for an unknown amount of time.  This week the pit has minimal water, surface moisture at most, and we were venting with the blower when we encountered high levels again. We attempted to move the blower downwind and upwind to alter results but with varying winds we couldn't keep up. Due to the nature of the exhaust pipe (see pictures, it's the short rusted pipe with the adapter on the end) it's exhausting directly at the intake point and with varying winds we kept seeing varying levels of CO. Upon removing the blower and waiting a few moments we were able to see acceptable levels in a short time.  Both blowers used, ours and the borrowed one we used last week have similar set ups where there isn't significant space between exhausting combustion gases and intake sites!

At 1035 Chris Mair requested to meet the subcontractor's management on scene to go over the excavation job and proper procedures that needed to be followed.  Upon arriving at the scene at 1100, it was confirmed that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation without proper shoring. American Water and the subcontractor went over with all personnel the excavation requirements and developed a plan forward. Workers widened the excavation but did not step the walls or reinstall shoring before reentering the excavation at 1130. American Water stopped all work at that time and notified the subcontractor's management of the issues. It was decided that a stop work order would be issued and that additional training needed to take place in order to ensure the safety of all workers involved. Training expectations were discussed and agreed upon between American Water and the subcontractor. AW directed that no work would continue until all training was completed and reviewed. In addition, American Water requested that an investigation report be submitted for the incident and a change in site supervisor/competent person be made.  The subcontractor removed the job site foreman from HAFB and revoked his DBIDS ID in order to prevent him from working on future AW projects. The DBIDS badge was returned to AW on April 22, 2016. Training for the subcontractor personnel occurred on April 25, 2016. Documentation of the training was provided to American Water on April 26 and the subcontractor was permitted to resume work at 0815.",-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"We were performing our 6 month inspection (2nd Bi-Annual Service) when we were checking the Vacuum Regulators filters when we found (2) broken indicating tube on the post chlorine gas feed system.  One unit had a 1/16"" hole in the glass and the other just had a crack. The hole and crack would allow air to be sucked into the regulator and lower the amount of Chlorine Gas being fed into the system, or if the system itself shuts off Chlorine Gas would exit into the air around the crack. This is caused by the Main Switchover device being set to high allowing the vacuum to build to a point that when it does switch over it projects the float to the top of the rotameter where a top stop is there to cushion the float.  Over time the top stop becomes hard (Chlorine Gas dries out the top stop) and causes the float to go in another direction which is to the side creating the crack.  We have adjusted the Main Switchover to switch at a lower rate and it will create less vacuum.  We also are changing the top stop every 6 months to keep a softer top stop in place.  ",-CHEMICAL

Not sure why this was done, maybe because bath was tripping breaker, but I think this will bypass ground fault breaker by keeping the ground fault protection device from working if the electric hot water heater element or other electrical part shorts out to ground. If breaker does not trip due to a short then when person placing samples into the water bath could get electrical shock through hand allowing the their body to become the path to ground instead of third prong on plug. Right now I left the water bath plugged into the extension cord because I am not sure why, or how long, the bath was plugged into extension cord in first place and I did not want to have the water bath get cold. But this needs to be investigated to see why the bath was plugged into the extension cord without a ground prong on the male plug. And this needs to be corrected by eliminating the extension cord and just plug the bath into the power strip on the wall that the extension cord is plugged into now. This also needs to be followed up on to see if this causes the breaker to trip.  If the water bath is tripping the breaker the bath, breaker, or wiring needs repaired or replaced.

"On the morning of Dec. 28, while I was performing my routine day-to-day survey of the Water Treatment Plant, I had walked around the building to find my immediate supervisor. I had greeted her, and we talked for a few minutes. At the time we had a contractor on site, so I figured that she was here to talk with him. So I proceeded with my daily duties, and on this particular  day I needed to add 2 chemicals to the day tanks; one being chlorine and the other being potassium permanganate. When an operator deals with any chemical it is required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment, in this case nitrile gloves and the use of a full face respirator. While I was adding the potassium permanganate, which for those of you who do not know what this is, it is a fine dusty powder which can become airborne, and is known as an oxidizing chemical. One that you would not want to get in your skin, eyes, nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Now while I was in the chemical room mixing this powder and water solution, my supervisor approached me and attempted to have a conversation with me. This was an unappropriate time for several reasons, 1) Supervisor put herself in a potential hazardous situation, with out donning the right PPE 2) Distracting an operator while performing a task such as dealing with chemicals 3) While wearing a full face respirator it is difficult to talk, and puts added stress on that operator. Now the things to take away from this incident are 1) If you see someone wearing PPE you might want to asses the environment, and question yourself if this is a safe environment for you to be in? 2) If you see someone wearing PPE and is clearly performing a duty, should you interrupt that person? -Yes, if that person is in or can be in danger. -No, the conversation can wait for a later time.

"The operator reported that the post chlorine feed system was not feeding properly.  Maintenance personnel were sent to the chlorine feed room to investigate.  The scale on the south post cylinders indicated 1980 pounds remaining in the cylinders.  Pressure on the header indicated ""0"" psi.  The post chlorinator was not indicating chlorine flow.  All indicated a blockage in the supply piping, vacuum regulator or automatic switch over device.  Chlorine feed was resumed through a bypass supply valve and the blockage was investigated.  There are two ton cylinders connected together to supply chlorine on this system.  When the whip was removed from one of the cylinders, it was noticed that there were two lead gaskets on the yoke to cylinder valve connection.  When the lead gaskets were removed, one gasket had a hole in it and the other lead gasket was solid.  This was the blockage.  The scale indicated 1980 pounds because one of the cylinders was depleted and the other was full due to the solid lead gasket.  When cylinders are delivered, a cap with a gasket is on the cylinder valve.  This cap is removed to attach the yoke valve.  The operator did not realize the solid lead gasket remained on the cylinder valve and attached the yoke valve with an additional lead gasket.  I spoke with our supplier about the incident and they informed me that some caps have a composite gasket and newer ones have a solid lead gasket.  what we learned from this incident is the importance of paying attention to details.  There should not have been two gaskets on the connection, one of them being solid.  Always remove any gasket and replace it with a new one.  Also, check for any foreign objects in the connection.  Suppliers may change little things and feel it is not necessary to inform the customer.  Comments were made by personnel that they had never seen a solid gasket in the cap.

Today was our second time raising our levels and we experienced a identical problem as we did last week. We encountered a rise is CO (carbon monoxide) on our borrowed LEL meter to the point where it went into alarm mode indicating a high level of CO present in the pit being measured approximately 12 feet down.  The first time, last week, we attributed the levels to the excessive amount of water and the fact that the pit hadn't been opened for an unknown amount of time.  This week the pit has minimal water, surface moisture at most, and we were venting with the blower when we encountered high levels again. We attempted to move the blower downwind and upwind to alter results but with varying winds we couldn't keep up. Due to the nature of the exhaust pipe (see pictures, it's the short rusted pipe with the adapter on the end) it's exhausting directly at the intake point and with varying winds we kept seeing varying levels of CO. Upon removing the blower and waiting a few moments we were able to see acceptable levels in a short time.  Both blowers used, ours and the borrowed one we used last week have similar set ups where there isn't significant space between exhausting combustion gases and intake sites!

"A Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) was replaced near housing on Hill Air Force Base.  Electrical work was scheduled to be performed by a contractor to complete the replacement project.  The contractor hired by American Water had subcontracted this electrical work out to another company.  The contractor met in the morning to discuss the job plan for the day and what hazards and mediations where necessary for the days work.  In discussing the electrical work it was decided that the work area would be a permit required confined space.  As the contractor was collecting the necessary safety equipment needed for the confined space the electrical subcontractor arrived on site.  Upon arriving at the work site the subcontractor proceeded to enter the PRV vault to complete his work, not waiting for the safety devices to arrive.  An American Water employee, Dan Bond, drove by the project and stopped in to check on the progress.  Upon arriving Mr. Bond noticed that the subcontractor was working in the vault with no confined space safety equipment.  Mr. Bond immediately instructed the subcontractor to stop working and exit the vault.  Mr. Bond then notified the EHS Specialist and his Supervisor of the issue.  The subcontractor's management was notified and work was halted until the safety equipment was on site and ready for use.

"Employee was in the C&P warehouse when he noticed a strong sewer like odor. He notified another employee who contacted Andrea Thomas about the odor. Andrea went over to the location and was able to determine that the strong odor was coming from the portable stop light trailer. Andrea recognized the odor as that of hydrogen sulfide, so she obtained a confined space meter and tested the atmosphere inside the enclosed trailer. The hydrogen sulfide alarm was activated and readings were stable around 15 ppm. Andrea called the manufacture and she had the trailer moved to the rear parking lot. Once outside, the trailer doors were opened to allow for ventilation. The atmosphere was tested inside the trailer before entry. Once the general atmosphere tested safe, Andrea tested each one of the four units battery compartments to determine the source. She found 2 of the four battery compartments to contain 73 ppm of CO, 5 ppm H2S and 7 ppm LEL (on average). We suspect that the ""smart charger"" is malfunctioning and is continuously charging the batteries causing them to over heat and off-gas harmful gases.

"A subcontractor was contracted by American Water to perform a water tie in on a water main southeast of the Roy Gate of Hill Air Force Base. On April 20, 2016 at 0830 American Water personnel arrived at the job site to turn valves and shut water off to the water main being worked on. At that time a trench box was in place and personnel were working in the excavation. The job site and excavation appeared to be in compliance with OSHA and AW regulations and requirements. AW advised the subcontractor personnel that a second trench box would be needed to complete the tasks or the excavation would need to be widened by sloping the excavation walls. Water was still flowing so AW personnel left the job site to exercise valves to see if the water could be isolated completely.  At 1000 AW personnel returned to the excavation. AW personnel noticed that the trench box was removed and tools were in the bottom of the excavation indicating that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation with out proper protection. At 1022 Chris Mair, AW Health and Safety Specialist, received notification from American Water workers of a possible issue with the subcontractor performing excavation work. At 1035 Chris Mair requested to meet the subcontractor's management on scene to go over the excavation job and proper procedures that needed to be followed.  Upon arriving at the scene at 1100, it was confirmed that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation without proper shoring. American Water and the subcontractor went over with all personnel the excavation requirements and developed a plan forward. Workers widened the excavation but did not step the walls or reinstall shoring before reentering the excavation at 1130. American Water stopped all work at that time and notified the subcontractor's management of the issues. It was decided that a stop work order would be issued and that additional training needed to take place in order to ensure the safety of all workers involved. Training expectations were discussed and agreed upon between American Water and the subcontractor. AW directed that no work would continue until all training was completed and reviewed. In addition, American Water requested that an investigation report be submitted for the incident and a change in site supervisor/competent person be made.  The subcontractor removed the job site foreman from HAFB and revoked his DBIDS ID in order to prevent him from working on future AW projects. The DBIDS badge was returned to AW on April 22, 2016. Training for the subcontractor personnel occurred on April 25, 2016. Documentation of the training was provided to American Water on April 26 and the subcontractor was permitted to resume work at 0815.",-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"We were performing our 6 month inspection (2nd Bi-Annual Service) when we were checking the Vacuum Regulators filters when we found (2) broken indicating tube on the post chlorine gas feed system.  One unit had a 1/16"" hole in the glass and the other just had a crack. The hole and crack would allow air to be sucked into the regulator and lower the amount of Chlorine Gas being fed into the system, or if the system itself shuts off Chlorine Gas would exit into the air around the crack. This is caused by the Main Switchover device being set to high allowing the vacuum to build to a point that when it does switch over it projects the float to the top of the rotameter where a top stop is there to cushion the float.  Over time the top stop becomes hard (Chlorine Gas dries out the top stop) and causes the float to go in another direction which is to the side creating the crack.  We have adjusted the Main Switchover to switch at a lower rate and it will create less vacuum.  We also are changing the top stop every 6 months to keep a softer top stop in place.  ",-CHEMICAL

I had greeted her, and we talked for a few minutes. At the time we had a contractor on site, so I figured that she was here to talk with him. So I proceeded with my daily duties, and on this particular  day I needed to add 2 chemicals to the day tanks; one being chlorine and the other being potassium permanganate. When an operator deals with any chemical it is required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment, in this case nitrile gloves and the use of a full face respirator. While I was adding the potassium permanganate, which for those of you who do not know what this is, it is a fine dusty powder which can become airborne, and is known as an oxidizing chemical. One that you would not want to get in your skin, eyes, nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Now while I was in the chemical room mixing this powder and water solution, my supervisor approached me and attempted to have a conversation with me. This was an unappropriate time for several reasons, 1) Supervisor put herself in a potential hazardous situation, with out donning the right PPE 2) Distracting an operator while performing a task such as dealing with chemicals 3) While wearing a full face respirator it is difficult to talk, and puts added stress on that operator. Now the things to take away from this incident are 1) If you see someone wearing PPE you might want to asses the environment, and question yourself if this is a safe environment for you to be in? 2) If you see someone wearing PPE and is clearly performing a duty, should you interrupt that person? -Yes, if that person is in or can be in danger. -No, the conversation can wait for a later time. Take 2 and think it through.",-CHEMICAL

"While staging a 50% caustic soda delivery, the delivery driver informed me that he was going to have to use a secondary pump attached to his truck bed to move the product from the tankard to the bulk tank.  After questioning the driver about the internal parts of the pump, it was determined that aluminum was believed to be in parts of the unit.  I immediately stopped the driver who seemed to be clueless as to the product he was dealing with and informed him that caustic has a negative reaction with aluminum which could result in an explosion of the pump.  I redirected him to hook the plant air directly to the tanker and pressurize the tanker in order to move the product.  ",-CHEMICAL-NEGLIGENCE

"The operator reported that the post chlorine feed system was not feeding properly.  Maintenance personnel were sent to the chlorine feed room to investigate.  The scale on the south post cylinders indicated 1980 pounds remaining in the cylinders.  Pressure on the header indicated ""0"" psi.  The post chlorinator was not indicating chlorine flow.  All indicated a blockage in the supply piping, vacuum regulator or automatic switch over device.  Chlorine feed was resumed through a bypass supply valve and the blockage was investigated.  There are two ton cylinders connected together to supply chlorine on this system.  When the whip was removed from one of the cylinders, it was noticed that there were two lead gaskets on the yoke to cylinder valve connection.  When the lead gaskets were removed, one gasket had a hole in it and the other lead gasket was solid.  This was the blockage.  The scale indicated 1980 pounds because one of the cylinders was depleted and the other was full due to the solid lead gasket.  When cylinders are delivered, a cap with a gasket is on the cylinder valve.  This cap is removed to attach the yoke valve.  The operator did not realize the solid lead gasket remained on the cylinder valve and attached the yoke valve with an additional lead gasket.  I spoke with our supplier about the incident and they informed me that some caps have a composite gasket and newer ones have a solid lead gasket.  what we learned from this incident is the importance of paying attention to details.  There should not have been two gaskets on the connection, one of them being solid.  Always remove any gasket and replace it with a new one.  Also, check for any foreign objects in the connection.  Suppliers may change little things and feel it is not necessary to inform the customer.  Comments were made by personnel that they had never seen a solid gasket in the cap.  Maybe not, but if you take your time and pay attention you may see lots of things you had not realized had changed.",-HAZARDOUS_CHEMICAL-CHEMICAL-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"This was found during a Bi-Annual Maintenance inspection on January 14, 2016.  It could have leaked Chlorine Gas (if the plant shut down) or pulled a Vacuum on the system and kept the Chlorine from feeding.  This is a defect in the back housing of this type of regulator.  I've seen it in many locations thru out our State as well as in other facilities.  We look for this every time we perform this service.  We typically catch it before it gets this bad.  This occurs because the insert inside the middle housing is recessed below the outer surface of the middle housing and when the back housing is attached, over time, it pulls down on the back housing and eventually cracks.  The manufacture has been notified and so far nothing has been done about it.  This style of regulator came out in 1996.  The cost of the back housing is around $30.  We have repaired the unit by installing a new back housing. Problem is solved at this location. ",-HAZARDOUS_CHEMICAL-CHEMICAL-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

"In an attempt to raise our tank levels we've been regulating our PRV's. Our PRV's are located in pits below ground level requiring, with our new training, the monitoring of the environment. Today was our second time raising our levels and we experienced a identical problem as we did last week. We encountered a rise is CO (carbon monoxide) on our borrowed LEL meter to the point where it went into alarm mode indicating a high level of CO present in the pit being measured approximately 12 feet down.  The first time, last week, we attributed the levels to the excessive amount of water and the fact that the pit hadn't been opened for an unknown amount of time.  This week the pit has minimal water, surface moisture at most, and we were venting with the blower when we encountered high levels again. We attempted to move the blower downwind and upwind to alter results but with varying winds we couldn't keep up. Due to the nature of the exhaust pipe (see pictures, it's the short rusted pipe with the adapter on the end) it's exhausting directly at the intake point and with varying winds we kept seeing varying levels of CO. Upon removing the blower and waiting a few moments we were able to see acceptable levels in a short time.  Both blowers used, ours and the borrowed one we used last week have similar set ups where there isn't significant space between exhausting combustion gases and intake sites!

Andrea went over to the location and was able to determine that the strong odor was coming from the portable stop light trailer. Andrea recognized the odor as that of hydrogen sulfide, so she obtained a confined space meter and tested the atmosphere inside the enclosed trailer. The hydrogen sulfide alarm was activated and readings were stable around 15 ppm. Andrea called the manufacture and she had the trailer moved to the rear parking lot. Once outside, the trailer doors were opened to allow for ventilation. The atmosphere was tested inside the trailer before entry. Once the general atmosphere tested safe, Andrea tested each one of the four units battery compartments to determine the source. She found 2 of the four battery compartments to contain 73 ppm of CO, 5 ppm H2S and 7 ppm LEL (on average).

"A subcontractor was contracted by American Water to perform a water tie in on a water main southeast of the Roy Gate of Hill Air Force Base. On April 20, 2016 at 0830 American Water personnel arrived at the job site to turn valves and shut water off to the water main being worked on. At that time a trench box was in place and personnel were working in the excavation. The job site and excavation appeared to be in compliance with OSHA and AW regulations and requirements. AW advised the subcontractor personnel that a second trench box would be needed to complete the tasks or the excavation would need to be widened by sloping the excavation walls. Water was still flowing so AW personnel left the job site to exercise valves to see if the water could be isolated completely.  At 1000 AW personnel returned to the excavation. AW personnel noticed that the trench box was removed and tools were in the bottom of the excavation indicating that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation with out proper protection. At 1022 Chris Mair, AW Health and Safety Specialist, received notification from American Water workers of a possible issue with the subcontractor performing excavation work. At 1035 Chris Mair requested to meet the subcontractor's management on scene to go over the excavation job and proper procedures that needed to be followed.  Upon arriving at the scene at 1100, it was confirmed that the subcontractor personnel had been working in the excavation without proper shoring. American Water and the subcontractor went over with all personnel the excavation requirements and developed a plan forward. Workers widened the excavation but did not step the walls or reinstall shoring before reentering the excavation at 1130. American Water stopped all work at that time and notified the subcontractor's management of the issues. It was decided that a stop work order would be issued and that additional training needed to take place in order to ensure the safety of all workers involved. Training expectations were discussed and agreed upon between American Water and the subcontractor. AW directed that no work would continue until all training was completed and reviewed. In addition, American Water requested that an investigation report be submitted for the incident and a change in site supervisor/competent person be made.

"Noticed that the Lab hot water bath (44.5 deg Celcuis) used to heat up bacti. samples had power cord plugged into a green extension cord that had the Ground Prong removed from the male end plug and this was plugged into the power strip on wall that went to ground fault breaker. Not sure why this was done, maybe because bath was tripping breaker, but I think this will bypass ground fault breaker by keeping the ground fault protection device from working if the electric hot water heater element or other electrical part shorts out to ground. If breaker does not trip due to a short then when person placing samples into the water bath could get electrical shock through hand allowing the their body to become the path to ground instead of third prong on plug. Right now I left the water bath plugged into the extension cord because I am not sure why, or how long, the bath was plugged into extension cord in first place and I did not want to have the water bath get cold. But this needs to be investigated to see why the bath was plugged into the extension cord without a ground prong on the male plug. And this needs to be corrected by eliminating the extension cord and just plug the bath into the power strip on the wall that the extension cord is plugged into now. This also needs to be followed up on to see if this causes the breaker to trip.  If the water bath is tripping the breaker the bath, breaker, or wiring needs repaired or replaced.

Not sure why this was done, maybe because bath was tripping breaker, but I think this will bypass ground fault breaker by keeping the ground fault protection device from working if the electric hot water heater element or other electrical part shorts out to ground. If breaker does not trip due to a short then when person placing samples into the water bath could get electrical shock through hand allowing the their body to become the path to ground instead of third prong on plug. Right now I left the water bath plugged into the extension cord because I am not sure why, or how long, the bath was plugged into extension cord in first place and I did not want to have the water bath get cold. But this needs to be investigated to see why the bath was plugged into the extension cord without a ground prong on the male plug. And this needs to be corrected by eliminating the extension cord and just plug the bath into the power strip on the wall that the extension cord is plugged into now. This also needs to be followed up on to see if this causes the breaker to trip.  If the water bath is tripping the breaker the bath, breaker, or wiring needs repaired or replaced. By being set up the way it is now I do not think it is safe and I feel like I need to bring this to managements attention. See attached pics.",-ELECTRICAL-NEGLIGENCE

Not sure why this was done, maybe because bath was tripping breaker, but I think this will bypass ground fault breaker by keeping the ground fault protection device from working if the electric hot water heater element or other electrical part shorts out to ground. If breaker does not trip due to a short then when person placing samples into the water bath could get electrical shock through hand allowing the their body to become the path to ground instead of third prong on plug. Right now I left the water bath plugged into the extension cord because I am not sure why, or how long, the bath was plugged into extension cord in first place and I did not want to have the water bath get cold. But this needs to be investigated to see why the bath was plugged into the extension cord without a ground prong on the male plug. And this needs to be corrected by eliminating the extension cord and just plug the bath into the power strip on the wall that the extension cord is plugged into now. This also needs to be followed up on to see if this causes the breaker to trip.  If the water bath is tripping the breaker the bath, breaker, or wiring needs repaired or replaced.

"We change sludge pumps in these holding tanks 2 to 3 times a year. The method we use is a homemade frame that is removable with a small wire rope hoist from grainger attached to this frame. A trap door has to be raised to get to this pump and raise it out of the tank with no railing around this door. When the pump is raised to the grating your standing on,  you have to move the pump to the edge of the tank with a 2 wheel dolly. The metal grating has a smooth edge on it so when its snowing or raining, like it was on the 12th, it is very slick. Moving this pump with the dolly on slick grating is not safe. I think this condition could be made more safe with an approved frame and trolly with an approved hoist to move this pump to the end of the tank. Also a removable hand rail around these trap doors and grating with a grooved edge for traction. ",SNOW-LOW_VISIBILITY-FALL-POOR_JUDGMENT-NEGLIGENCE

I immediately got down off ladder and inspected closely, upon this inspection I found a hairline crack in one of the fiberglass legs on the ladder which I did not see on the initial inspection.  This crack was allowing this leg to buckle once weight was applied thus causing the excessive movement while on it.  Ladders are equipment that we use daily and I will definitely be looking very close at the legs(structure) of any ladder I get on going forward as a hairline crack is very hard to spot.
